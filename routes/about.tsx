            Because I wasn't happy with{' '}
            <a href='https://theverge.com' class='underline'>The Verge</a>'s "new" layout, but still love to follow
            their writing, I decided to spend a little bit of time setting up an RSS feed aggregator specifically for
            their feeds. This website is the result of that effort and simply lists articles from their feed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href='https://theverge.com' class='underline'>The Verge</a>'s website contains more information than just
            their articles. If you are looking for that additional content, just visit their website.

            I used <a href='https://tweakers.net' class='underline'>tweakers.net</a>{' '}
            as inspiration for the layout. Articles added since your last visit will display the time in bold. The

            styling to indicate which links you have already visited.
